## ðŸ“… Dates
- Project completed: June 2024
- Uploaded to GitHub: August 2025

## ðŸ“œ Description
Built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using classification algorithms and customer demographic & transactional data.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest
4. Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
5. Final model deployment-ready notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` â€” Jupyter notebook with full workflow
- `customer_data.csv` â€” Dataset used (if permissible)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
This project was completed during MSc coursework for **Machine Learning for Business** module.
